Note about model aliases:

So far, Users are associated to Listings and Orders with the aliases 'seller' and 'buyer', respectively.
(below: not yet implemented)
When necessary, JSON response objects will include a nested user object under the appropriate alias in order to access relevant details.
Example: 'order.buyer.username' and 'listing.seller.username'
