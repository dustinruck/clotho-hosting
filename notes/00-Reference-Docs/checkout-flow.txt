Initial idea of the flow of making a new order:


user clicks "checkout" button

GET cart items

check all items "isSold" = false

    if items are sold, return to front end "x, y, z items are sold" (to notify user)
    -- remove sold items from cart
    -- continue with checkout of non-sold items

    checkout:
        transaction:
            change item states to sold in DB

            STRIPE stuff

            apply stripe ID to items in DB

frontend: take user to "view order" page

    GET order by ID (stripe ID?)
